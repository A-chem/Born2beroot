The **/boot** directory in a Linux system holds the files needed to boot up (start) the system. It contains:

1. **Kernel**: The core part of the operating system that interacts with hardware.
2. **Bootloader**: Software that loads the kernel and starts the system (e.g., GRUB).
3. **Initial RAM Disk**: Temporary file systems used to help the kernel load the actual file system.

In simple terms, **/boot** is where the computer stores the essential files to start the operating system. Without these files, the computer wouldn't be able to boot.
