A **package** in Debian is a file that contains all the necessary files and information to install a program on your system. It usually includes the program itself, libraries it needs, and instructions on how to install or remove it.

### Key Points:

- **Format**: Debian uses **.deb** files for packages.
- **Includes**: The program files, dependencies (other software it needs), and installation instructions.
- **Installation**: You can install, update, or remove packages using commands like **apt** or **dpkg**.

In short, a **package** in Debian is a way to bundle software and make it easy to install and manage on your system.
