**`sudo`** stands for **"Superuser DO"** and is a command in Linux and UNIX systems that allows a user to run programs or execute commands with **superuser (root) privileges**. It provides controlled access to administrative tasks without needing to log in as the root user.
### Key Features of `sudo`:

1. **Privilege Elevation**:
    
    - Temporarily grants a regular user root privileges for executing specific commands.
2. **Secure Access**:
    
    - Tracks and logs all commands executed with `sudo` for auditing and security purposes.
    - Users must enter their password to confirm their identity before using `sudo`.
3. **Granular Control**:
    
    - The system administrator can configure what commands a user can run as root using the `sudoers` file (located at `/etc/sudoers`).
4. **Avoids Root Login**:
    
    - Reduces security risks by allowing administrative tasks without requiring users to directly log in as the root user.
