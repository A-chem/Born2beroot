A **mount point** is simply a location (usually a directory) in your file system where an external storage device, like a hard drive or a USB drive, is "attached" so that its contents can be accessed by the system.

When you connect a storage device (e.g., an additional hard drive or USB drive), you need to tell the system where to access it. The **mount point** is the directory where the device is made accessible.
### Example:

- Imagine you have a USB drive. You can mount it at a folder like `/mnt/usb` (this folder is the mount point). Once mounted, the files on the USB drive can be accessed by looking inside `/mnt/usb`.
