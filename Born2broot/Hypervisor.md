Is software that allows you to create and run **virtual machines (VMs)** on your computer. It acts as a middleman between your computer's hardware and the VMs, making it possible to share resources like CPU, memory, and storage.
### Types of Hypervisors:

1. **Type 1 (Bare-Metal)**: Runs directly on the computer's hardware.  
    Example: Used in servers and data centers.
    
2. **Type 2 (Hosted)**: Runs on an existing operating system.  
    Example: VirtualBox or VMware Workstation for personal use.
